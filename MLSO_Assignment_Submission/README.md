## Implementation Details

### 1. MLP Architecture
The Multi-Layer Perceptron is built from scratch with the following specifications:

```
Input Layer: 784 neurons (28Ã—28 flattened MNIST images)
Hidden Layer 1: 512 neurons + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
Hidden Layer 2: 256 neurons + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)  
Hidden Layer 3: 128 neurons + ReLU + Dropout(0.2)
Output Layer: 10 neurons (MNIST digit classes 0-9)
```

**Key Features:**
- Xavier/Glorot weight initialization for better training
- Dropout regularization to prevent overfitting
- Dynamic layer construction for easy architecture modification

### 2. Distributed Training with PyTorch DDP
Instead of Horovod (which has complex dependencies on macOS), we use PyTorch's built-in **DistributedDataParallel (DDP)**:

- **Process Management**: Uses `torch.multiprocessing.spawn()` to launch multiple processes
- **Data Distribution**: `DistributedSampler` ensures each process gets unique data batches
- **Gradient Synchronization**: `dist.all_reduce()` synchronizes gradients across processes
- **Backend**: Uses "gloo" backend for CPU-based distributed training

### 3. Mini-Batch Training Implementation
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch size per process
- **Data Loading**: Efficient data loading with multiple workers
- **Validation**: Separate validation set with proper distributed evaluation
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: StepLR scheduler for adaptive learning rates

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- **Per-Epoch Timing**: Tracks time for each training epoch
- **Communication Overhead**: Measures time spent on gradient synchronization
- **Metrics Tracking**: Training/validation loss and accuracy
- **Results Visualization**: Comprehensive plots and JSON output

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Installation
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}')"
python -c "import torchvision; print('TorchVision installed successfully')"
```

## Running the Implementation

### Option 1: CPU Version (Recommended for macOS)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python mlp_mnist_ddp_cpu.py
```

### Option 2: Full Version (GPU/CPU)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python mlp_mnist_ddp.py
```

### Configuration
You can modify the training configuration in the script:

```python
config = {
    'input_size': 784,           # 28x28 MNIST images
    'hidden_sizes': [512, 256, 128],  # Hidden layer sizes
    'num_classes': 10,           # MNIST digits 0-9
    'dropout_rate': 0.2,         # Dropout for regularization
    'batch_size': 32,            # Mini-batch size per process
    'num_epochs': 10,            # Number of training epochs
    'learning_rate': 0.001,      # Learning rate
    'weight_decay': 1e-5,        # L2 regularization
    'lr_scheduler_step': 3,      # LR scheduler step size
    'lr_scheduler_gamma': 0.5    # LR scheduler gamma
}

# Number of processes (world size)
world_size = 2  # Change this to test different numbers of processes
```

## Performance Analysis

### Communication Overhead
The implementation tracks communication overhead through:
- **Gradient Synchronization**: `dist.all_reduce()` operations for parameter gradients
- **Metric Aggregation**: Synchronizing loss and accuracy across processes
- **Timing Measurements**: Per-batch and per-epoch communication time

### Scalability Features
- **Data Parallelism**: Each process handles different data batches
- **Model Replication**: DDP automatically replicates the model across processes
- **Efficient Communication**: Minimal communication overhead through gradient aggregation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Change the port in the script
   os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12356'  # or any other port
   ```

2. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce `batch_size` in the configuration
   - Reduce `num_workers` in data loaders
   - Use smaller hidden layer sizes

3. **Slow Training**
   - The CPU version is intentionally slower for demonstration
   - For production use, consider GPU acceleration
   - Reduce `num_epochs` for faster testing

### Performance Tips
- **Batch Size**: Larger batches generally provide better GPU utilization
- **Number of Workers**: Adjust based on your CPU cores
- **World Size**: Start with 2 processes and increase gradually
