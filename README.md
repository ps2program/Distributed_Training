## 🏗️ System Architecture

The implementation follows a **master-worker pattern** with distributed data parallelism:

- **Master Process (Rank 0)**: Coordinates training and aggregates results
- **Worker Processes**: Execute parallel training on data partitions
- **Communication**: Gloo backend for CPU-based distributed training
- **Synchronization**: Gradient aggregation using `all_reduce` operations

## 📊 Performance Results

- **Training Accuracy**: 98.25% in 5 epochs
- **Training Time**: 39.68 seconds total (7.94s per epoch)
- **Scalability**: 1.8x speedup with 2 workers
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized for 16GB+ RAM systems

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **MLP Architecture**: 784 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 10 neurons
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
